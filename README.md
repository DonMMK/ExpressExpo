Last Updated: October 27, 2025 

# üõ†Ô∏è 1. Setup

## What this guide will cover

This guide will cover the steps to go from having an idea to developing, deploying and making an income from a mobile app.
You dont need to know how to code to follow this guide as it will leverage AI tools to help you with the coding and development process. 
Throughout the process you will learn concepts and overtime you will understand your code better and be able to improve on your work.

## What You Need and Why

| Google Play Developer account | (US$25 one‚Äëtime) | To release to the Play Store |
| Expo account | Generous free tier then usage based cost | For building and deploying your app |
| Firebase or Supabase account | Generous free tier then usage based cost | For backend and database |
| AI coding assistant (e.g., GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude Code) | Usage based cost | To expedite the development process |
| IDE (e.g., VSCode, Cursor, Webstorm ) | Free | This is what you use to edit your code. VSCode is reccomended to set up your coding assistant yourself or you can use Cursor which also comes with integrations with AI Coding assistants |

## Technology Stack

- **Expo (React Native)** for cross‚Äëplatform mobile apps
- **Firebase** or **Supabase** for backend and database
- **RevenueCat** for in‚Äëapp purchases or subscriptions
- **PostHog** for analytics

Assuming you've never built a mobile app before, or even written a line of code, this guide will walk you through the entire process step‚Äëby‚Äëstep.
Lets imaging building a app like a resturant. A resturant has a front of house where customers interact with the menu, place orders and enjoy their meals. The back of house is where the chefs prepare the food, handle orders or even reaching out to external vendors to get more ingredients.

When you imagine it this way it makes it easier to understand the different components of a mobile app. The front of house is like the frontend of the app that users interact with, while the back of house is like the backend that handles data storage, user authentication, and other server‚Äëside logic.

For our mobile app, we will use Expo (React Native) for the frontend, Firebase or Supabase for the backend.
We will have external services running in the app to handle payments (RevenueCat) and analytics (PostHog).

# üé® 2. Design

- Curated **ChatGPT prompt templates** to ideate UI/UX and flows
- UI Kit: e.g., React Native UI Lib for consistent components
- Use chat gpt to genereate image + context profile
- Doing a static splash screen for minimal product + doing animations for it
- Theme selection and custom styling guidelines for both light and dark theme or using one set of color palette that doesnt switch

## Color Palette
- Use tools like [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) or [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/create) to generate a cohesive color scheme
- Choose primary, secondary, accent, background, and text colors
- Ensure good contrast for readability and accessibility


## App Icon Design
- Tools like chatgpt can genrate images based on your app concept
- you can use a combiurastion of chatgpt genreated designs then impoirt into figma or canva to refine and finalize the design


## Styling and UI Library
- Think painting by hand using your own colors and brushes rather than using a paint by numbers kit
- obviously each have their own advantages and disadvantages. stylesheets give you more control and flexibility but take more time to set up and maintain. UI libraries give you a faster way to get started with pre built components but can be limiting in terms of customization and may lead to a less unique look and feel for your app.

## In App Content
- Use AI image generation (e.g., Midjourney, DALL¬∑E) for custom graphics
- Ensure no copyright issues with generated images

## Animated Splash screen

- Set up lottie asset using chat gpt to get transparent background
- then split elements
- add to lottie lab with the moving element on top of the static one on elements
- do animation by changing the positions create animation keyframes
- install lottie react native and code up
- to avoid the flicker have the first frame as a static image and then animate from there

# üßë‚Äçüíª 3. Development

## Core Practices

- Version control with Git/GitHub
- Use AI‚Äëdriven development agents
- Modular component structure for scalability
- Responsive design for various screen sizes
- Enforce security best practices (auth/authz, env vars)

## Quick start
- You can create a new expo project following the instructions on the expo website [here](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/) or clone the expressexpo template from github [here](https://github.com/DonMMK/expressexpo).
- If you create a new expo project you can go to the section Tooling - ExpoGo below to get started, but if you clone the expressexpo template you can skip to the section Creating your first Expo Development Build below as you cannot use expo go with the ExpressExpo template as it uses native code for some of the features.

## Tooling - ExpoGo


## Creating your first Expo Development Build
- Follow the instructions on the expo website [here](https://docs.expo.dev/development/introduction/) to set up your development environment and create your first development build.

## Feature Requests

- If you are using the expressexpo template this already has code for a basic app structure with auth, navigation, backend and some generic components so you can then build on top of this and add your own features. For example if you are making a budgeting app you can break down into creation budget feature, tracking expenses feature, viewing reports feature etc.
- Do it in chunks so you are not creating a massive PR that is hard to review or confusing the AI and writing code that is bloated and broken
- Create merge requests for each feature. This makes it easier to review changes and ensures that each feature is properly tested before being merged.
- Using Git / Github for this. Think of it like a save point in a game. If something goes wrong you can always go back to the last save point.

## Debugging & Logging

- UI add colors to different components to visually see where things are
- For backend use firebase logging and monitoring



## Environments

- When setting up the project ensure to set up different environments for development and production. This allows you to test features and changes in a safe environment before pushing them to production users who may be relying on the app. This also ensure you do not accidentally alter customer data or other important information.
- Multiple firebase projects for dev and prod. 
- Use of Expo config + AWS Key vault to manage different environment variables for dev and prod builds

## Authentication, Authorization & Security

- Think of this using a person trying to enter a building analogy and hotel room key analogy
- Authentication is like checking the ID of a person trying to enter a building. You want to make sure they are who they say they are before letting them in. This is typically done using usernames and passwords, or other methods such as social logins (Google, Facebook, Apple, etc.) or biometric authentication (fingerprint, face recognition, etc.)
- Authorization is like giving a person a key to a specific hotel room within the building. Even if they are allowed to enter the building, they may not have access to all areas within it.
- For authentication use Firebase Authentication or Supabase Auth. These services provide a secure and easy way to manage user authentication.
- For authorization, you need to do authz on all backend operations to ensure that users can only access their own data. This is especially important if you are dealing with sensitive information such as financial data, personal information, etc.

## Onboarding

- On first launch take user to onboarding flow design to maximize engagement
    - this is where you have the most attention from the user to highlight the app
    - you can even use this as an opportunity to give a preview of the app's features and then pop up with a paywall if you have one
    - include images that are attention grabbing


## Data & APIs

- Configure optimized CRUD + auth flow in Firebase
- Integrate external APIs (e.g., budgets, alerts) with secure tokens

---

# üöÄ 4. Deployment

## üß™ Testing & Debugging

- UI debugging tools (Reactotron, React Native Debugger)
- Test builds using TestFlight (iOS) and internal tracks (Android)
- Recruit ~20 testers via Reddit, X, etc.
- Test the UI and buttons and other stuff because Android and iOS have slight differences that cause things to work / not work
